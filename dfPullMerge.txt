The git pull command is used to fetch and download the content from a remote reposistory and immediately update the local repository
git pull is a combination of two separate commands, git fetch and git merge. git fetch retrieves the latest version of a branch from the remote repository,
but it does not merge the changes with your local repository. git merge takes the change that were fetched and integrates them into the local
repository. git merge is a command that is used to merge two branches together
