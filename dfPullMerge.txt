The git pull command is used to fetch and download the contents from a remote reposistory and immediately update the local repository
The git pull command is a combination of two separate commands, git fetch and git merge. The git fetch command retrieves the latest version of a branch from the remote repository,
but it does not merge the changes with the local repository. The git merge command takes the changes that were fetched and integrates them into the local
repository. The git merge command is a command that is used to merge two branches together.
